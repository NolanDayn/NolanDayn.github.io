									<h1>Tube Radio</h1>
									<p>Over the past few months I have been working on restoring an old tube radio from 1963 that was kindly given to me.
										It is still a work in progress but I am proud of this project because it was an large undertaking into an unfamiliar area.
										Which required me to learn many new things and be creative and methodical due to lack of documentation. 
										I think this project really improved my understanding of electrical and electronic systems.

								<p>Above are the pictures of the radio when I received it. As can be seen it was in need of a good clean. After cleaning it
									quite a few changes had to be made for saftey before it could ever be plugged in. These include replacing old capacitors,
									measuring the transformer windings resistances to make sure it is still safe, adding a fuse, and begining the long process
									of replacing almost all the frayed cloth covered wires. Tube radios operate at a very high voltage (This one is 110V plate)
									so extreme caution needed to be taken to not cause fire or damage.<br/> <br/>

									This is a superheterodyne receiver not very different from the popular American 5 radio with one major exception being it has 
									a transformer which is very good because the chassis ground is floating. Many American 5 had a hot chassis and unpolarised plugs which
									is a major hazard. I also patched the speaker which had holes in it with glue and coffee filters lol. The speaker is very special due 
									to its large signal transformer and electromagnet which doubles as a large inductor in power supply filtering.
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/SpeakerRepair.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									At this point the power pupply and amplifier stage of the radio are working and I am able to play songs out of it supplied by an 
									aux cord. I still need to get the RF amplifiers working for it to be a proper radio. Unfortunatley due to school and other commitments
									this project is on the back burner for now. But it sounds pretty good though a little quite.
