									<h1>Digital Stethoscope</h1>
									<p>For our final year Capstone Engineering Project my teamate Connor and I chose to design a Digital Stethoscope.
									With the idea that it would allow medical or other proffesionals to amplify, dampen, record, store and visualize sounds.
									As an extra add on we are also working on training machine learning modules to detect heart murmurs and other sounds.
									The project has no been completed and worked well.

								<p>Above is the PCB we designed using Altium and then later produced. It includes an ESP32 WROVER running a modified version of FreeRTOS
								 which forms the communication and computation backbone of the design. Along with a MEMS I2S Microphone, Headphone Amp and DAC, battery charger,
								 power supply and battery voltage monitoring circuit.</p>

								<p>Here are pictures of the PCBs before they are populated and the horn we 3D printed and designed for the stethoscope.
									The horn was designed using equations and information provided by this very informative paper. <br /> https://www.grc.com/acoustics/an-introduction-to-horn-theory.pdf
								</p>

								<h3>Assembly and Testing</h3>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/steth_oven.jpg" alt=""  /></div>
								<p>We then proceeded to assemble the PCBs using tools at the College lab such as the reflow oven and soldering iron,
								After that we began testing the PCBs many systems and bringing up the board.</p>

								<h3>Programming</h3>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/steth_open.jpg" alt=""  /></div>
								<p>We were able to sucessfully program the board and get all systems working as hoped. A simple enclosure was also made for the device.</p>

								<h3>Final Results</h3>
								<p>In the end the stethoscope was able to do everything we hoped. Pick up heart sounds, play these sounds through headphones and amplify or
								 dampen the signal. It could also transmit these signals over WiFi to a server which hosted a web application capable of playing back the audio
								and graphing the signal. The design was not without a few minor faults however. In future iterations it would benefit a great deal from sound
								insolation in the case and a better fitting cone as it picked up a lot of background noise. A more sophisticated battery charger IC and battery
							protection methods would be required before this product could be certified or used in testing. A smaller battery and more compact case could also be used.
						However, we were happy it was able to meet all its requirements and thought it performed well for a first iteration.</p>
